# Philadelphia Reflections   
## The musings of a physician who has served the community for more than six decades   

This represents the rewrite of a PHP/MySQL blog initially written in 2006.   

* PDO is used so the objects' parameters are entirely contained in the database and PDO::FETCH\_CLASS is used to instantiate them.   

* Twig is used as an HTML template engine    

The website is [http://www.philadelphia-reflections.com](http://www.philadelphia-reflections.com)    

----------------------------------

The ```vendor``` folder created by twig and ```public_html/secure``` folder with database credentials are hidden by ```.gitignore``` and contain ```.htaccess``` files to prevent internet access.

The content of this website is a compilation of the thoughts of a man who went to Yale to become a Shakespearean scholar but who was
ordered by his country to become a physician (Endocrinology and Infectious Disease) to treat American soldiers during WWII.

After his wife (also a physician during an era when that was both rare and difficult) became ill
he retired to care for her and took up his long-dormant passions for literature and history. 

Shakespeare and Ben Franklin feature prominently but as he saw the medical profession changing in ways he disagreed with the focus shifted to his thoughts on medical policy.
