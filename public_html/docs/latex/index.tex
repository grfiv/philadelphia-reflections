\subsection*{The musings of a physician who has served the community for more than six decades}

This represents the rewrite of a P\+H\+P/\+My\+S\+QL blog initially written in 2006.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P\+DO is used so the objects\textquotesingle{} parameters are entirely contained in the database and P\+D\+O\+::\+F\+E\+T\+C\+H\+\_\+\+C\+L\+A\+SS is used to instantiate them.
\item Twig is used as an H\+T\+ML template engine
\end{DoxyItemize}

The website is {\tt http\+://www.\+philadelphia-\/reflections.\+com}

H\+T\+ML doxygen documentation can be found at {\ttfamily public\+\_\+html/docs/html/index.\+html} which can be accessed directly via {\tt doxygen documentation} 



The {\ttfamily vendor} folder created by twig and {\ttfamily public\+\_\+html/secure} folder with database credentials are hidden by {\ttfamily .gitignore} and contain {\ttfamily .htaccess} files to prevent internet access. \#\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+

The content of this website is a compilation of the thoughts of a man who went to Yale to become a Shakespearean scholar but who was ordered by his country to become a physician (Endocrinology and Infectious Disease) to treat American soldiers during W\+W\+II.

After his wife (also a physician during an era when that was both rare and difficult) became ill he retired to care for her and took up his long-\/dormant passions for literature and history.

Shakespeare and Ben Franklin feature prominently but as he saw the medical profession changing in ways he disagreed with the focus shifted to his thoughts on medical policy.
