\subsection{Detailed Description}
Stub of a P\+HP file that created a Google map in blogs based on geo tags

This is a stub because I attempted a rewrite and failed. It\textquotesingle{}s a nice feature but it will take more work than I am currently willing to invest, compounded by the fact that Google complains that I\textquotesingle{}m using V2 and I need to upgrade to V3.
